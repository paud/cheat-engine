globaldisassembleoverride is fucked


structure dissect: 
  delete all structures sometimes AV's (no idea how to reproduce)


memview paste: paste for specific displaytype
memview->rightclick while debugging: Change eip to position, run till position in the context menu as well


trainergen: get rid of tcheat and just use labels

graphical memory view: 
  change format makes it black sometimes(loses position ?)
  sometimes the x position is not 0, but can't be changed back

memview debugging: add a toolbar for single step/step over so you can debug by clicking icons

dbvm_speedhack

find higher resolution icons

graphical tutorial: continue with it

linux: make a 32-bit linux build with .so injection support
memscan: Don't combine the scanresults into a single file. Leave them split up (skip: for 6.7 or 7.0)

ceshare: continue with it
pseudocode: continue with it
mac version: work on it


make more frequent releases ffs


define from debug data: Use a ownerdata list instead (or better, a whole new interface where you can see beforehand the layout)

structure compare: sortable offset columns
structure compare: Locking a column will invalidate miltilevel entries
structure compare: make the groupboxes resizable

structure compare: Closed a previous structure compare followed by reopening a new one and loading a file, messes up the popupmode and other stuff
 
threadview registers: Add "copy value to clipboard"

changed addresses: add Change value there

pointerscan: High dpi window starts too small, and the progressbar is too low
pointerscan: On reopening the pointerscan settings window, the dropbox is too small
pointerscan: generating pointermap should also check terminated

pointerscan: when suspending a scan, CE closed itself(crash)

changed addresses by: If the instruction is movss, set the default display type to float
changed addresses by: Besides a list also keep a map of addresses in the list for quicker response

vehdebug: Fix reattach (need to move the threadpoller to CE)

gui: override gui font gives error in lua
groupscan generator: high dpi start too small
